# RestartVote
A Minecraft plugin which lets players vote if the server should restart or not

Note:
--

This plugin runs /restart, which is requires a start file, if you dont have a file called start.sh (start.bat on windows) in your root server folder, this tool can generate it, just dont forget to rename the file it outputs to start.sh (start.bat if your server is hosted on a windows machine):
https://startmc.sh/
